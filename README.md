# Belly_Button_Challenge
## Overview of Project 
Improbable Beef wanted to improve the taste of their product by finding bacteria that will help the product tast more like real meat. Volunteers provided their own bacteria by swabbing their belly buttons, provide demographic data, the type of belly button (i.e., innie "I" or outie "O"), and the frequency of washing their belly button per week. A dashboard was created to organize and visualize the data. The dashboard allows users to filter data and interact wioth charts. You can find this dashboard through the GitHub Pages link: https://masiedunc.github.io/Belly_Button_Challenge/
